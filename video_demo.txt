Hi — I'm Shaik Peda Khasim, Candidate ID Naukri0925.
This is my Book Finder app for Aganitha.
(Show the app)
1) Search for "harry potter" — results appear with covers and authors.
2) Show no-results handling (search for random string).
3) Resize to mobile to show responsiveness.
4) Open key code files (src/api/openLibrary.js and src/components/BookCard.jsx).
5) Show chatgpt_conversation.txt (LLM proof) and README with Candidate ID.
Thank you — I can explain choices in interview.
